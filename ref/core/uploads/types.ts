/**
 * @file core/uploads/types.ts
 *
 * Responsibility: Type definitions for upload targets.
 * Describes the contract that every upload target must satisfy, and the
 * result shape returned after a successful (or failed) upload.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - UploadResult always includes success/failure status and a human message.
 * - The upload function receives a fully formed ExportBundle, never raw sessions.
 * - Credentials are resolved at call time, never stored in the result.
